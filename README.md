My first github repository (of many, I hope!).

Hello, Wor--Everyone!

After tinkering with programming off and on (mostly off) for many, many years, I've finally decided to make a true go of it. I am slightly nervous, but very excited, as I feel like "this" is where I am meant to be. I look forward to learning. I suppose that's a good thing, because I know I have a great deal to learn!
